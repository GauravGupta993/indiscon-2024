            INDISCON 2024 will provide an excellent forum for the dissemination 
            of the latest research and ideas in a wide range of Science, 
            Engineering and Technology. The conference is keen to disseminate 
            state-of-the-art knowledge on specialist and latest topics related 
            to the theme of the conference through dedicated Special Sessions.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p className={styles.subheading}>
                Submission of proposals for such Special Sessions 
                for the INDISCON 2024 are welcome.</p>

            <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Guidelines for Special Session Proposers</h2>
            <p className={styles.subheading}>
            The Special Sessions should provide the conference attendees with 
            an insight view of research topics that are not covered by the regular tracks. 
            They can also be focused on particular research niches within the greater topic 
            of a regular track; however, it is important that such sessions offer sufficient 
            diversity from the main topic. Therefore, the proposers are invited to highlight 
            the difference between the contents of their submission and the regular tracks.
            </p>

            <p className={styles.subheading}>
                Special Session Organizers are expected to operate within their 
                professional networks to promote their session and INDISCON 2024. 
                Having an invited paper/presentation will help to attract more interest, 
                hence it is strongly encouraged. Accepted special sessions will have 
                4-6 oral presentations. A Special Session can be one of the following:
            </p>

            <h3 className={styles.subheading}>(a) Special Session with an invited presentation</h3>

            <p className={styles.subheading}>
            The organizers invite a leading researcher on the topic of the 
            Special Session who provides an oral presentation in the Special Session. 
            The organizers provide the name of the presenter together with an email 
            confirming their acceptance and an abstract. No full paper is requested, 
            nor will the abstract be published in IEEE Xplore.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className={styles.subheading}>(b) Special Session with an invited paper</h3>
            <p className={styles.subheading}>
            The organizers invite a leading researcher on the topic of the Special Session 
            who provides an oral presentation in the Special Session. The organizers provide 
            the name of the presenter together with an e-mail confirming their acceptance. 
            The presenter, together with possible co-authors, prepares a full paper and 
            submits it to the INDISCON 2024 conference by the stipulated deadline. 
            The paper will be peer-reviewed and must reflect an innovation providing a 
            significant novelty to the state-of-the-art in its (sub)field. The paper, 
            if accepted and presented, will be submitted for the possible publication in IEEE Xplore.
            <br/>
            Note: No financial assistance is available from the conference to support the participation of the presenter of an invited paper/presentation. The Special Session Organizer and all presenters in the session are required to register and pay for the conference.
